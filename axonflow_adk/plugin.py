"""AxonFlow governance plugin for Google ADK.

`AxonFlowPlugin` extends `google.adk.plugins.BasePlugin` and routes the six
governance-relevant hooks through the existing `axonflow` Python SDK
(`pre_check`, `audit_llm_call`, `check_tool_input`, `check_tool_output`,
`audit_tool_call`) so every model + tool call across every agent on the
Runner is governed.

Three hard design constraints:

1. **Reuse the `axonflow` Python SDK.** The plugin does not speak raw HTTP.
   Auth, retry, observability, and version pinning are inherited from the
   SDK that already ships to PyPI as `axonflow>=8.0`.

2. **A buggy plugin must not break the agent.** Every hook is wrapped by a
   per-call timeout (default 5s) and a half-open circuit breaker (default
   open after 5 consecutive failures, recover after 30s). When the circuit
   is open or a hook errors, the plugin **fails open** (returns None and
   lets the model/tool call proceed) so an AxonFlow outage cannot take
   down every ADK agent registered on the Runner.

3. **`require_approval` fails closed.** Unlike the generic failure path,
   when policy explicitly requires human approval, the plugin polls the
   HITL queue and short-circuits the call with a deny on rejection,
   expiry, or polling timeout. Approvals are safety-critical; defaulting
   to "allow" here would silently bypass governance.

The plugin signatures match `BasePlugin` exactly (keyword-only args, async
def, optional return). See
https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/plugins/base_plugin.py
for the canonical hook surface.

Cross-language clone discipline (Java / Go / TypeScript / Kotlin /
OpenAI Agents SDK):

  • All SDK invocations use keyword arguments. Positional args are an
    anti-pattern here because the SDK reorders + renames params across
    minor releases, and the cross-language clones cannot mirror Python
    positional binding rules.
  • The 4-step HITL flow is canonical: gate → create_hitl_row → poll →
    resume/deny. Same shape in every language.
  • Defensive defaults (timeout, half-open breaker, fail-open per hook,
    fail-closed on approvals) are part of the contract, not the
    implementation — clone them.
  • `enable_hitl_polling` defaults to True. Callers who want
    deny-fast must set False explicitly.
